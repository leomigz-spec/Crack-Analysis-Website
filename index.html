  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This research focuses on developing a crack analysis measuring device to
    assess the structural integrity of buildings. The system utilizes a
    peridynamics-based model to analyze crack propagation and structural damage.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="problem">
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Manual crack inspection in buildings is often subjective, time-consuming,
    and prone to human error. Undetected crack propagation can lead to severe
    structural failure and safety risks.
  </p>

<section id="objectives">
  <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To design a crack analysis measuring device for buildings</li>
    <li>To evaluate crack behavior using the peridynamics model</li>
    <li>To improve early detection of structural damage</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="methodology">
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The proposed system captures crack measurements using sensors and applies
    peridynamics modeling to analyze stress distribution and crack propagation.
  </p>
