# Crack-Analysis-Website
This website seeks to detect cracks, analyze crack behavior, and assess the structural condition of buildings with better accuracy. By integrating real-time crack measurements with Peridynamics modeling, this research aims to contribute to safer infrastructure, improved failure prediction, and enhanced building safety monitoring.
